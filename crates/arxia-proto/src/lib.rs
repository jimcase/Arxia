//! Protobuf definitions for the Arxia wire protocol.
//!
//! # Pre-decode validation (HIGH-010, commit 040)
//!
//! Wire bytes that arrive on a transport (LoRa / BLE / SMS / TCP /
//! satellite) MUST be validated against
//! [`MAX_TRANSPORT_FRAME_BYTES`] BEFORE being handed to
//! `prost::Message::decode`. The audit (HIGH-010):
//!
//! > Send a 4 GB `bytes payload` in a frame. prost decoder
//! > allocates; OOM. Wrap decode in a length-prefixed reader with
//! > a hard cap, reject larger.
//!
//! Callers invoke [`validate_transport_frame_bytes`] on the wire
//! `&[u8]` before calling `decode`. Out-of-range frames are
//! rejected with [`ProtoError::TransportFrameTooLarge`] without
//! any prost allocation — the cheapest possible OOM-vector
//! closure.
//!
//! `MAX_TRANSPORT_FRAME_BYTES` = 1 MiB (1 048 576 bytes), aligned
//! with the audit's batch-frame ceiling.
//!
//! # Post-decode oneof gate (HIGH-011, commit 041)
//!
//! Prost's default decode of a message with a `oneof` field
//! **silently drops** unknown field numbers — the parsed message
//! arrives with `payload: None`. The audit (HIGH-011):
//!
//! > Send a gossip envelope with a oneof field number that isn't
//! > in the proto definition. Prost's default behavior drops the
//! > variant silently; caller sees an envelope with no variant
//! > set and may treat it as a no-op or panic on `.unwrap()`.
//!
//! Callers MUST gate the decoded envelope on
//! [`require_envelope_payload`] before dispatch. The helper is
//! generic over the inner variant type so it works for
//! `GossipEnvelope.payload`, future `TransportEnvelope.body`,
//! etc. Empty envelopes are rejected with
//! [`ProtoError::EnvelopePayloadEmpty { envelope_kind }`] where
//! `envelope_kind` is the caller-supplied label for log
//! readability.
//!
//! Together the two validators close the prost-side OOM and
//! silent-drop attack surfaces at the `arxia-proto` crate
//! boundary. Every transport binding (`arxia-transport`, future
//! LoRa / BLE / SMS adapters) inherits both checks transparently.

//! # Protoc availability flag (LOW-008, commit 080)
//!
//! `build.rs` checks for `protoc` and either compiles the
//! `.proto` definitions normally OR writes a stub
//! (`// protoc not found - stub generated`) and emits a
//! `cargo:warning`. To make the stub mode runtime-detectable,
//! `build.rs` also sets one of two cfg flags:
//!
//! - `arxia_proto_real` — protoc was found, real types exist.
//! - `arxia_proto_stub` — protoc was missing, stub generated.
//!
//! The constant [`PROTO_STUB_ACTIVE`] mirrors the cfg as a
//! const bool so callers can introspect at runtime without
//! using `cfg!()` macros.
